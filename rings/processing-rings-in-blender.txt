- Repair the mesh with netfabb
- Open in blender (File -> Import -> STL) -> object properties -> Modifiers -> 
  Decimate -> Collapse.
- Export at ratio 0.2 and 0.05 (proportion of faces remaining after 
  decimation). Continue with whatever looks good. Apply the modifier to commit 
  it and start operating on a smaller mesh (phew!)
- Save as 2017.blend for active development
- Translate (g) and rotate (r) to roughly align the ring with the axes. After 
  pressing (g) or (r) you can press (x/y/z) to lock to an axis. You may also 
  want to rotate about the 3D cursor (look it up)
- Tab -> edit mode. Use the bounding box (b) and circle (c) select tools in 
  wireframe viewing mode (look it up) to select and delete (x) unwanted 
  vertices/edges/faces from the scan.
- Tab -> object mode. Add (A) a circle (set vertices to ~150) and rotate (r) 
  and scale (s) it to line up with the inside of the ring. Translate (g) the 
  circle as necessary.
- ...but you actually wanted to center the ring instead of uncentering the 
  circle, so look up the new center of the circle (n toggles the toolbar) and 
  translate the ring and circle back to the origin.
- Recenter the 3D cursor (Shift + C). Tab -> edit mode. Create another circle 
  aligned with the outside of the ring. It doesn't seem to align perfectly -> 
  align it more with the bottom than the top.
- Select the circles (a or Alt + right click (+ shift)). Extrude (e) them 
  circles in both directions beyond the extent of the ring.
- Switch to the side view and bisect (t toolbox) the cylinders on the planes 
  that form the sides of the ring. It might be useful to be in wireframe view 
  while drawing these lines
- Select (b) the outer vertices of the cylinder and delete them, leaving only 
  the section within the bounding planes.
Alternative directions to shape the bottom correctly:
- Select only the outer circle (C and Shift + C in front view (1)). Switch to 
  the side view (3) and deselect the middle (Shift + B). Switch back to the 
  front view and scale (S) down to size. Switch to side view (3) and translate 
  the center line to the center.

- Switch back to the front view and delete the sections of the circles that 
  overlap with the ring, leaving a slight gap between the two meshes. Use a 
  radial cutoff from the center (I used a plane through the origin rotated to 
  the desired angle as a guide)
- Select the front sides of the inner and outer circles. Create a face (f) 
  between them. Then do the same with the backs. Now they form a tube that 
  could actually be the bottom of the ring. Select those faces and triangulate 
  them (Ctrl + T).
- Temporarily create faces on either end to form a closed volume. This makes 
  text creation work better
- Back to object mode. Center the 3D cursor (Shift + C) and create a circle (A 
  -> Curve -> Circle). Rotate (rx90) and scale (s) it to line up with the 
  inside of the ring.
- Create a text object (A -> text). Change the text (edit mode) to MIT OPENS 
  DOORS. In object mode go to the font toolbar. Center the text and scale it to 
  the desired size.
- Add a curve modifier to the text to curve it about the circle. If the text is 
  now backwards then rotate it around the circle (ry180) and translate it back 
  to the desired location (gz, gy, gx).
- Convert the text to a mesh (Alt + C) -- this will apply the curve modifier.
- Switch to edit mode and select the text (a). Duplicate it (e + ESC) and scale 
  (s) it to "extrude" radially. Note that this requires the 3D cursor to still 
  be at the origin (Shift + C).
- Switch back to object mode and add a boolean modifier to the new circle 
  geometry to subtract the text. Hide the text object and you should be able to 
  see the engraved text. Apply the modifier.
- Edit mode for the ring; use Alt + right click to select the edge loops you 
  want to attach to the new geometry. If Alt + right click doesn't select the 
  full loop, delete the triangle it gets stuck on and try again. If any full 
  triangles are selected delete those as well. Merging the ring with the new 
  geometry won't work well unless you do this.
- Edit mode for the new geometry -- delete the extra faces you added for text 
  engraving.
- Object mode -- select both the ring and the new geometry and join them 
  (Control + j)
- Edit mode. Subdivide (t toolbar) the edge loops on the new geometry (~20 
  subdivisions; the goal is to have about the same number of vertices on each 
  edge loop). Then for each side select the new geometry edge loop and the 
  original geometry edge loop and run "bridge edge loops" (space -> search -> 
  bridge edge loops). If you get a funny result then take a closer look at your 
  scan edge loops -- they may not be good loops.

## Top separation


### Make the top artwork into a separate part

- Top view (7), use a bounding box select (b) to select a super set of the 
  artwork. Then switch to front (1) and side (3) views and bounding box 
  deselect the wrong parts of the mesh (b; shift + drag). Then switch back to 
  the top (7) and use bounding box deselect (b; shift + drag) to cull out 
  connecting pieces. This doesn't have to be perfect.
- Separate selection into a separate part (p). Translate it in z out of the way 
  and hide it; we'll come back to it later.

### Delete the artwork-to-ring connecting pieces

- Use circle select (c) with a large circle (scroll wheel) to select a super 
  set of one side's connecting mesh. Then use bounding box deselect in the top 
  (7), front (1), and side (3) views to remove the excess. Delete (x) faces.
- Repeat for all four sides. Now the ring should have a large hole in it with a 
  small shelf over it around the edges.

### Build a cavity in the ring with a shelf to set the artwork on

- Top view (7) create a plane (A -> plane). Resize (s) and translate (g) it so 
  it roughly fills the cavity. You might find it useful to set the 3d cursor as 
  the center for scaling (some icon; look it up). Front-ish view (1) looking 
  slightly up and translate the plane down until it just barely doesn't cross 
  into the inside of the ring. This is the bottom of the cavity.
- Extrude it most of the way up -- this is the walls of the cavity up to the 
  shelf.
- Subdivide it into a 3x3 grid and move (g) the subdivisions to near the edges 
  at the desired width of the shelf. Switch to face select mode and delete the 
  middle face. Then select the other faces and extrude them up the height of 
  the shelf.
- This extrude operation creates extra faces on the inside of the ring that you 
  don't want. They can't be seen from most angles, but you should find and 
  delete them.
- Select one side of the ring edge loop at a time and align all the points by 
  scaling to 0 (sx0 or sy0).
- Subdivide the edge loop of the extrusion. Select both it and the ring edge 
  loop and bridge them (Space + search + Bridge Edge Loops). Once again, if you 
  get weird behavior then delete weird triangles from the edge loop until it 
  looks right.

### Build a platform for the artwork that fits on the shelf

- Switch parts to the top artwork and make a plane. Translate and scale it so 
  it takes up most of the space on the shelf. Translate it to rest on the 
  shelf.
- Translate the artwork down until it's just above the plane. If it sticks out 
  too high above the top of the ring then scale it in z (sz) until it doesn't 
  anymore. Hide the ring to make the artwork and plane both accessible.
- Subdivide the plane's edges (~80 subdivisions).
- Look at the model from below and delete any vertices of the artwork that 
  stick out -- they won't fit in the ring.
- Clean up the artwork's edge (delete vertices that cause bad behavior and 
  scale each side to size 0 to align the vertices) and bridge its edge loop to 
  the plane.
- Lower the top artwork onto the shelf.
- Switch to edit mode for the ring. Add a second material, color it blue, and 
  apply it to the top of the shelf. Now if you look from the top (7) you can 
  see how much of a gap you have between the top artwork and the ring. Resize 
  (sx, sy) the artwork as necessary to make this gap a reasonable size. You may 
  also want to use the ruler (Space + ruler) tool.
- Admire your work.

## Fix normals

This may be necessary for both parts:

- Switch to edit mode (tab) and open the toolbar (n). Under "Mesh Display" 
  click the icon for faces to display the normals. If they aren't all in the 
  same direction, recompute face normals (ctrl + n).
- When I did this I found some faces in the ring that hold the top pieces were 
  oriented wrong because there were missing faces that should have connected 
  them to the rest of the model. I might have an error in the steps for making 
  the shelf -- check to make sure no faces are missing. Use (h) to hide 
  selected faces and (Alt + H) to unhide them.
  - Bridge edge loops seems to work best when the normals are pointing the 
    right way

## Export STLs

For each part:

- Select the part
- File -> Export -> STL. Find the checkbox for only exporting the selected 
  part.
